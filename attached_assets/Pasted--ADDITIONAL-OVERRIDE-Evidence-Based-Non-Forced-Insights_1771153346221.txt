## 🔧 ADDITIONAL OVERRIDE — Evidence-Based, Non-Forced Insights + Teacher Accountability Rules

This section OVERRIDES any previous rules that force insights purely from correctness thresholds or time heuristics.

### A) Do NOT force insights (strict rule)
1) The system MUST NOT generate an insight unless there is clear supporting evidence from at least one of:
   - transcript text (Arabic excerpts)
   - chat content (Arabic excerpts)
   - poll/participation signals (answered rate, skip rate, correctness trends)
2) If evidence is weak or inconclusive, output:
   - "No strong signal detected for this area in the data."
3) Keep insights concise: max 1–2 sentences per insight. No filler, no “because it’s weird” expansion.

### B) Remove fixed timing prescriptions (standardize)
REMOVE any rule like:
- "<50% correctness => teacher should explain 1–2 minutes"
- ">70% correctness => 0–30 seconds is enough"
Timing can be mentioned ONLY if it clearly correlates with an observed problem (e.g., repeated confusion signals, repeated wrong answers, multiple clarification requests) AND the transcript supports it.

### C) Teacher accountability boundaries (CRITICAL)
The teacher MUST NOT be held accountable for:
- number of topics covered
- breadth of curriculum content
- what content is taught (this is curriculum-driven)

Teacher IS accountable for:
- clarity of explanation
- engagement behaviors (prompts, checks for understanding)
- responsiveness to confusion
- motivational/encouraging communication
- facilitating student participation during activities

**All insights must be framed around delivery and interaction, not content scope.**
Example phrasing:
✅ "Clarification was missing after confusion signals."
❌ "Too many topics were covered."

### D) Replace time-only activity transcript analysis with meaningful signals
For each activity (and for combined Section Checks), generate at most:
- 0–3 "What Worked"
- 0–3 "Could Improve"

Signals you MAY use (non-time-based):
1) Engagement prompts: teacher asks students to respond, explain, vote, or type in chat (evidence: transcript excerpt).
2) Comprehension checks: teacher asks "did you understand", asks for reasoning, asks for steps (evidence: transcript excerpt).
3) Responsiveness: teacher addresses confusion or questions seen in chat (evidence: chat + transcript proximity).
4) Explanation correctness/consistency (delivery-focused): detect contradictions, unclear steps, or mismatched instructions vs the question intent.
   - Only flag if there is strong transcript evidence (e.g., conflicting stated rule/step or self-correction).
5) Student participation quality: many skipped answers, low completion, or no chat responses after prompts (data signal).
6) Reinforcement quality: praise/encouragement used appropriately during struggle moments (evidence: transcript excerpt).

Timing overlap (teacher speaking during activity) should be treated as a *context detail*, not an automatic negative. Only flag if it likely interfered (e.g., students asking confusion questions, high skip rate, repeated wrong answers during the overlap).

### E) Concise insight formatting requirement
All transcript-derived insights MUST follow this compact structure:

Insight:
- Category: {Clarity | Engagement | Responsiveness | Motivation | Instruction Consistency}
- Statement: 1 sentence
- Evidence: timestamp + short Arabic excerpt (<= 20 words)
- Linked Signal (optional): {skip rate / completion / correctness / chat confusion count}

If you cannot provide evidence, do not emit the insight.

### F) Teacher Communication section comes BEFORE Deep Transcript Analysis (order change)
Reorder analysis sections as:
1) Teacher Communication & Motivational Style Analysis (tone, reinforcement, encouragement)
2) Deep Transcript Analysis (only if meaningful signals exist; concise)

### G) Rewrite “Deep Transcript Analysis” to be shorter + only meaningful
Replace the earlier “4.X Transcript Intelligence & Deep Insight Extraction” behavior with this:

#### Deep Transcript Analysis (Concise)
Generate ONLY these outputs:
1) Key Strengths (0–3 bullets)
2) Key Risks (0–3 bullets)
3) Top Coaching Suggestions (0–3 bullets)

Rules:
- No topic counting.
- No long multi-step rubrics.
- No exhaustive toggles.
- No “moment” lists unless there is a strong signal.
- Each bullet must include evidence (timestamp + Arabic excerpt) or be omitted.

### H) JSON Output Update (minimal + clean)
Add/replace these fields in DashboardData:

teacherCommunicationInsights: {
  toneSummary: { rating, highlights[], improvements[] }   // each item concise + evidence
  reinforcementSummary: { rating, highlights[], improvements[] }
  engagementBehaviorSummary: { promptsSeen, checksForUnderstandingSeen, responsivenessSeen }
}

deepTranscriptInsights: {
  strengths: [ { category, statement, timestamp, evidenceText, linkedSignal? } ]
  risks:      [ { category, statement, timestamp, evidenceText, linkedSignal? } ]
  coaching:   [ { category, statement, timestamp, evidenceText, linkedSignal? } ]
}

### I) Quality gate (hard stop)
Before returning DashboardData:
- If an insight lacks evidence -> discard it.
- If insights exceed limits -> truncate to limits.
- If there are no strong signals -> return empty arrays + “No strong signal detected” summary line for that section.
